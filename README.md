# Details that were not resolved that I at least detected until now.

## Slider
*Background image of the slider, bottom border, I have not been able to hide the blured border outside the photo
*The layout of the trailer, buy buttons and some others in this section does not look good on various screen sizes, it needs to be adjusted for mobile  sizes in spacial
*Trailer link: json fil that i use  didn't have that information so is not added yet.

## Gallery
*The buy buttons lead to the buy section but do not yet select the movie

## Buy Ticket
*Form field labels do not respect the original layout desing, they should descend on the fields a little more
*Reset form function still not working (it clears the selected data in memory but does not clear the form on the screen)
*popcorn background images should go more above.
